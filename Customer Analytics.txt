Customer Analytics

Predictive Analytics: RFM
- recency: how recently they made a purchase, last time 
- frequency: how many
- monetary value: overall monetary value

These three are used for future prediciton in regression modeling. For period 2 , regression models sufficient.

For customer acquisition and CLV, need to project way into future. Can roll over period to period but that is limited. With no data to use as input, then can't 
predict the output. For when / long-run type questions.

Regression for next period churn - not for outside range of data. 

Customer Lifetime value:

Notes :

Look at customers on a chohort basis: acquired around same time , through same channel, same campaign or same first purchase with the company.
Customers doing things or not doing things over a period of time. Using a product, coming into store, etc. 

RFM : recency more important than frequency moe important than monetary value.

No action could mean: 
- lapsed: leaving the pool of customers
- dormant: decided against it for a period
Need a model to determine which. Based on recency and frequency we can make an educated guess about probability of lapsing and decide where to devote resources.
Based on best guessof proabilty of death and propensity to donate- get expected frequency of future donations.
Note: recency limited to most recent period of consideration.

Probability model

- each person has a proabilty model for their behaviour 
- bayesian ? Beta Distribution- can capture range of probaility functions of donation, death coin- lapsing
- likelihood of lapsing and likelihood of dormance
- heterogeneity for both - don't overgeneralize

Buy till you die model: see links for how to implement these models
- short term: regression model


Prescriptive Analytics

Descriptive: map data to patterns
Predictive: take data on past behvaiour and predict future behaviour
Prescriptive: give a recommendation

Problem definition: 
- set of goals: maximize volume sold or revenue, profit
- set of actions that may be taken: change price, 
- model that describes how actions impact the goal: regression model , or other

Tradeoff: in most models best to identify tradeoff beforehand

Introducting Parameters in model
- introducing costs : look for marginal revenue vs marginal cost
- optimal when MR = MC

Market Structure:
- single customer vs multiple
- price elasticities
- what are other competitors doing when we change price ?
- WTP: willing to pay per item
	take increase in revenue at a given price / 0.5
- with single customer consider offering a bundle at a given price: look at what they are willing to pay per item and match that
- with multiple consumers all buying one item, focus on volume is correct

strategic interaction: in game theory deals with how to respond to competitve moves

Online Advertising: 
- attribution: using clickthrough rate to see proportion of customers who clicked through
	- # channels ad shown to consumer
	- clickthrough % of customers who clicked the ad
	- consumer theory and industrial organization


Martketing Analytics:
- build infrastructure to get data
- exploration: basic 
- prediction: customer analytics
- optimizing future: pricing, emailing, discounting for optimization
- business action:

Judge the value of customers by cost to serve individual customers. Make profit one customer at a time.

Customer analytics: colleciton, management, analysis and strategic leverage of an organization's granular data about the behaviour of its customers.
- inherently granular: focus on individual level
- behavioural: focus on observed behavioural pattern(s), not demographics or attitudes
- forward looking: orientation toward prediction - not jsut description
- multi-platform: combine behavours frommultiple measurement systems
- broadly applicable: industry agnostic view of "customer"
- multidisciplinary: marketing, statistics, computer science, info sci, OR

note: focus on past behaviour over stated intention data

Effect of individual level prices on catalog shopping behaviour?
Impact of frequency and timing of catalogs/mailers on purchase behaviour ?
How does product assortment influence household purchase behaviour ? 
What types of advertising appeals/messages are more/less effective ?

Need to link offline and online purchase and customer data.

Problems:

Advertising Attribution problem: how effective is display (long-term) vs SEM (short-term) digital advertising
- current practice is last click

How do customers utilize multiple media platforms? (cannibalization?)
- media optimization or channel cannibalization problem

GRP: reach * frequency
- gross rating points: more GRPs more they can charge for advertising 
- reach: as many customers
- freq: volume of content

Findings:
- Channels don't cannibalize each other long run as heavy users for each don't decrease
- channels do slightly cannibalize each other on a given day
- total engagement goes up- mobile + online

How valuable are price discounts?
- 2/3 of value comes from person the discount is offered to but 1/3 comes from the people they interact with after the promotion is offered to them.
- Can track social media data to figure out the impact on who they talked to and where/when they talked to them

What is the ROI of Facebook?
- likes/ mentions ?
- Regression inputs: online exposure to banner ads, exposure to TV ads of same brand, invitation from friend to like the page and seeing it in someone's status
  					-> purchase: the person in question buys brand

Facebook and Online have greater short-term effects
TV has longer carry-over
- whe comparing to cost markets are efficient- the total integrated impact over time is proportional to cost

New Datasets:
- shopping plan: unplanned purchases
- shopping path: where in store, shelfspace
- field of vision
- spatial data on where customers go in-store

Five steps for TSP:
- do you want efficient shoppers or wanderers?
1. data:new data
2. manage:heat maps to analyze
3. analyze: analyze under TSP framework
4. action:who to target?
5. business decision

Order deviation and Travel deviation: inefficeint order of purchasing and inefficint route -> wanderers spend more on average
- then need demographics to segment and target the exact customer

Recall and consideration impacted by views but choice less so. 

Data capture, Analysis, prediction and action

CLV = sum T m*( (r^t)/ (1+d)^t )

Call Ordering: routing to better customer service reps based on the client's tone.

Technology meets management science. Real monetization.

Data: infrastrueture to collect right data
Data exploration: figure out what you're looking for. Things model might not show
Prediction: churn modeling and lifetime value
Optimization: who to advertise , set price, who to contact via email 
Decisions: amazon prime - getting product to nearby warehouses pre purchase
